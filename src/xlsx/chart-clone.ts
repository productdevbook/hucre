// ── Chart Clone ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Bridges the read-side `Chart` metadata produced by `parseChart` to the
// write-side `SheetChart` shape consumed by `writeXlsx`.
//
// Use case (issue #136): a template workbook stores one of each chart
// flavor; at export time the caller pulls a chart out, swaps its data
// ranges and labels, and re-emits it (often several times) into a new
// workbook. The two type families overlap — `ChartSeriesInfo` already
// mirrors `ChartSeries` — but the read side has no anchor and supports
// kinds the write side cannot author yet, so a dedicated converter
// keeps the type-narrowing explicit.
